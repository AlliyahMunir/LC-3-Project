> This is a ReadMe for an LC-3 Bubble Sort Algorithm Group Project

## General info
In the language of LC-3, me and my peers created a program that uses bubble sort algorithm to output a set of numbers in ascending order. These numbers are chosen and inputted by the user. To be specific, when the program runs the user is asked to enter a number ranging from 0 - 100. This prompt will loop 8 times, then the user will receive an output of those 8 numbers placed in ascending order using bubble sort algorithm.

## How To Use
In order to be able to use the LC-3 program above, one must have installed an LC-3 Simulator as well as an LC-3 Editor on their desktop. Furthermore, a mouse and a keyboard are recommended in order to input your choice of values to run the program. For more information, check out the documentation file uploaded above!
